		<help><![CDATA[Configures xinetd to use the authpriv log facility, which writes log entries to the /var/log/secure file. Adding a directive such as FILE /var/log/xinetdlog would create a custom log file called xinetdlog in the /var/log/ directory.
SYSLOG syslog_facility [syslog_level] 
The log output is sent to syslog at the specified facility. 
Possible facility names include: daemon, auth, authpriv, user, 
mail, lpr, news, uucp, ftp local0-7. Possible level names 
include: emerg, alert, crit, err, warning, notice, info, debug. 
If a level is not present, the messages will be recorded at the info level.

FILE file [soft_limit [hard_limit]] 
The log output is appended to file which will be created if it 
does not exist. Two limits on the size of the log file can be 
optionally specified. The first limit is a soft one; xinetd will 
log a message the first time this limit is exceeded (if xinetd 
logs to syslog, the message will be sent at the alert priority 
level). The second limit is a hard limit; xinetd will stop 
logging for the affected service (if the log file is a common log 
file, then more than one service may be affected) and will log a 
message about this (if xinetd logs to syslog, the message will be 
sent at the alert priority level). If a hard limit is not specified, 
it defaults to the soft limit increased by 1% but the extra size must 
be within the parameters LOG_EXTRA_MIN and LOG_EXTRA_MAX which default 
to 5K and 20K respectively (these constants are defined in xconfig.h).
